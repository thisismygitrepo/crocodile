# populates build, dist and .egg directories:
# python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
# twine upload dist/*
# Locally: (only once)
# pip install -e . # add --user if there is .toml file
# .toml and setup.py conflict, so make sure only one exists.
# at the moment, setup.py is less likely to cause error on older versions of python.

# The files backed up here OneDrive/AppData/home/.pypirc saves the credentials needed by Twine to uploade to pypi
# Note: the tag v.54 or whatever convention is followed must be consistent as pypi decides on which version is the latest
# based on that. E.g. if the version was named 5.6 as opposed tp v5.6 then 5.6 will appear as old release.
# similarly if v5.6 is used instead of v5.60, then 5.6 will not be the latest



# the root directory belongs to gitrepo, it can have any name.
# the package name is dictated by 'name' field in setup.py file.
# the modules that are avilable after installation are the names under src directory, which can be different again.
# it is however good practice to unify all of the above.
